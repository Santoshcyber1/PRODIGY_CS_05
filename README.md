**Explanation:**

A packet sniffer tool captures and analyzes network packets passing through a network interface. It extracts key details such as source and destination IP addresses, protocols (e.g., TCP, UDP), and payload data. This information is displayed in a user interface, enabling users to observe and analyze network traffic in real-time. The tool allows users to start and stop packet capture as needed, offering a snapshot of network activity for educational or diagnostic purposes. Ensure the ethical use of the tool for these purposes.
